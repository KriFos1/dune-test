    @brief Facace classes and implementations for tuples of dense vectors

    In a dense vector tuple each element is an implementation of
    Dune::DenseVector. The facade class Dune::DenseVectorTuple adds
    functionality to expected by any dense vector to the tuple. In
    particular, vector space operations are provided by a number of
    overloaded operators (\f$+, -, +=, -=, *=\f$, etc.).
