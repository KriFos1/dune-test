Introduction

CMakeLists - Reference of available CMake custom modules.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description

The "cmake" executable is the CMake command-line interface.  It may be used
to configure projects in scripts.  Project configuration settings may be
specified on the command line with the -D option.  The -i option will cause
cmake to interactively prompt for such settings.

CMake is a cross-platform build system generator.  Projects specify their
build process with platform-independent CMake listfiles included in each
directory of a source tree with the name CMakeLists.txt.  Users build a
project by using CMake to generate a build system for a native tool on their
platform.
